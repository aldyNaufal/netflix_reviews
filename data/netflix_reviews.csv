I just cancelled my membership. The new plans are ridiculous. I didn't sign up to a streaming service to PAY FOR ADS. Advertisers pay Netflix to show us the ads... and then they have the nerve to charge us to watch them (or pay extra to remove the ads). It's so greedy. They get paid twice to run their ads.

Netflix knows this, it shows the watch history on the titles page. Row after row is mostly full of the same titles (min 50% dups), making the split rows pointless.

Major complaint is price. Just keeps going up and now is 24.99 a month. Automatically renews and DOES NOT NOTIFY YOU ABOUT INCREASES. The content doesn't offer alot of new items and netflix originals are using cheaper actors that are unheard of. You dont raise costs because you lose viewers. Apple tv is only 9.99 a month I'm discontinuing services before it renews and before they raise prices yet again.

I LOVED Netflix and did for years until this new update. The Korean series that are in English dialogue but the subtitles are now in Korean NOT English like it used to be for years and years I DO NOT LIKE AT ALL‚ÄºÔ∏èüòí Why did Netflix do this? Please change it back or atleast give us an option in a drop down window. I'm not watching Netflix like I used to and I'm thinking about ending my subscription. I really relied on the English subtitles no matter what the language is.üòî,2,2025-04-05 06:53:47,A Google user

Aside from it's feature that it could be connected on TV I think this app is just average. there's a lot more watching sites with far better features. Sometimes when the connection is poor the quality adjusts automatically and there's no icons to choose what quality you prefer so the visual quality naturaly becomes poor which affects the watching experience and I had wished there's 2x fast forward for scenes I don't like much. Also no screenshots! seriously? too much ~_~ I at least pay you know.,3,2025-04-04 22:20:52,A Google user

Great Shows but terrible app .... really it irritates a lot.... the video keeps loading again and again after starting any movie or show.... it Shows black screen and the video keeps loading.... although the trailer plays perfectly fine but when I try to watch the movie it keeps loading even though I have a high-speed connection... everything works fine all other OTT apps plays smoothly... only netflix sucks.... then I have to restart my device and then the video plays but this works only 1 time,1,2025-04-03 23:52:43,A Google user

show quality vs price is a no brainer free apps offer much more shows aren't that And only had 1 new movie or show I would watch every 6 months not worth it at all.

Netflix is great I can't lie. But the only thing that I don't like are the seasons they offer for anime. Like they offer just enough seasons/episodes to get you hooked and then just leave you hanging. Like for jjk they only offer 1 season. and the worst thing is that they have enough money to license all the seasons. I would like it if they get all of the seasons of anime or get none at all cos its really frustrating! and also it would be cherry on top if they can get Attack on Titan!!,3,2025-03-26 23:50:16,A Google user

Yup just milk the most out of your customers that barely have enough money for anything. Yup keep raising the price every month and taking away benefits for people with a lower cost plan. We just want to watch tv but we can barely afford that with the price inflation of everything meanwhile you guys are a multi billion dollar company that just wants more and more money. The rich get richer the poor get poorer. You guys don't give a damn about us all you care about is being more rich. Whata joke,1,2025-03-26 08:58:20,A Google user

Recent update sucks. I hate that the platform has ads now. Might be worth canceling for how bad it's gotten. Edit: (7/29/23) It has somehow gotten worse for more money. Netflix is insane. Edit: Netflix is a money hungry company that does not care about the people who use it. The selection of shows/movies to watch is awful and outdated. The original shows aren't worth getting attached to because they are likely going to be canceled anyway. This is the epitome of enshitification. Not worth $,1,2025-03-19 00:58:21,A Google user

Netflix used to be great but it has been certainly dropping in quality and I am frankly fed up with their approach to canceling shows after just 1 season even ones with high ratings. I have gotten to where I don't want to watch anything on it anymore unless it has 2-3 seasons out. The latest price increase also is unjustifiable. I am actively working toward pushing the house to other options to get rid of Netflix. It isnt worth it anymore and Netflix needs to change.,1,2025-03-17 00:26:29,A Google user

Used this app for years and previously had 5 stars. Since the Android update at the end of Feb 25 the app no longer works effectively with Goole Pixel Phones. You have to clear cache and storage and reboot the phone before opening the app twice to get it to work. It won't stay open in the background with inactivity so if you use this app a lot like me it's really not working!! Netflix two weeks on still has no support.

"It's hit and miss. For someone who finds modern movies boring and lacking creativity and gripping storylines the options for nostalgic movies from the 80s, 90s and 2000s is limited. A lot of the movies are being marked ""leaving soon"" and/or removed already. Finding something to watch is proving to be a struggle as a result.

I'm trying to stop them repeating the overcharging for march 25. It's very difficult to get through because they refuse to acknowledge they have overcharged.

It's good but the fact that you can add only up to five profiles in Netflix is stupid it should at least have the option to at the very least add 10 profiles especially for big families to respect their privacy and another thing if you're going to add anime then at least translate it to English so that everyone can at least watch for example I noticed some anime you have that I saw before the used to be English but no longer has the option of watching in English anymore that is very very stupid.,3,2025-02-24 03:42:39,A Google user

Disappointed with the change to include ads unless you pay even more. I get annoyed when recommendations are all things I've already watched. Take watched items off of recommendations.

The platform is nice and tidy. I like the search when you don't have a title it shows related titles. The download feature is nice for trips or on the plane. At first I hated the mobile game push but now I see the games have been a nice addition more trustworthy and no ads high quality. Now for the price increases $17.99 monthly!?

"A near 20% price increase last year. A 26% increase this year. A claim of 84 new arrivals coming soon (weasel words if I've ever heard them). Are these arrivals new content or from several decades ago? Netflix's own content is poorly rated garbage (Seven Samurai set in Space as an example). It struggles with 720p, how's it going to handle 1020p? The free to air offerings here outstrip the cheap flops you push at me. Simply not worth the price.",1,2025-02-12 17:40:28,A Google user
"If you have Italian subscription and visit Spain, most of the content is changed to spanish and english, even if in Italy it has italian audio option. Absolutely ridiculous if you cannot use it while travelling because you don't speak english or the country language which is the case for our grandparent that mostly use Netflix. Curiously, italian option disappear but slovak, polish and some other languages appear in Spain, which makes no sense to me. If you only watch Netflix it's ok.",1,2025-02-12 17:39:00,A Google user

I shared a netflix account in the same household as my mom for over a decade now. But since we have two different wifi networks it won't allow us to share anymore even though we are 5 feet apart room wise. Honestly unsubbed and went to disney/hulu since they have no issues with family sharing with family and offer better selection. Plus remember netflix said you could share with family at one point? Yeah guess that dream is long gone. Also price raising just for one person to use account ??,1,2025-02-10 06:28:20,Lacey Six

I hope everyone boycotts you,, plus your servers suck I couldn't even watch the fight , I want a refund Horrible service, I spend more time looking for a movie since they are all terrible.. and I get recommended whatever Netflix wants like movies made in India, absolutely not..

"Overwhelming about of ""Netflix Own"" content, which just all looks and sounds like it's come out of the same studio with the same directors, writers, producers. Increasingly tedious and now you are HIKING the prices in the UK yet again. Definitely not paying for standard and I'll look at ditching it altogether. I've found great alternatives since I started feeling I had to look elsewhere, anyway. Shame the platform ended up becoming a cash cow and not a thoughtful content provider.",2,2025-02-07 17:50:04,J E Lyon

My account on Netflix has been hacked twice despite having extremely complex passwords. I am certain that noone could have gotten into my account using the password. This means Netflix's privacy & security protocols are very very poor. Additionally Netflix does not let you close one account and open a fresh one. It will only let you cancel the subscription which means one has to go back and use the same hacked account again. I am absolutely done with this app.,1,2025-02-07 03:43:31,anuja malvi
Unjustified pricing as Netflix has one foot out the door with their content investments. They wanna break into anime yet they are scared to compete with the likes of Crunchyroll.

App was working just fine and since this morning I cant watch anything downloaded as the app says there is a problem and then restarts my phone. Now I have to sit for 3 hours staring at a roof as your app has failed. Even after updating still does not work,1,2025-02-05 20:58:01,natassha2 nortje

"I use Netflix as a leisure activity after completing my professional obligations, or when seeking to watch a particular show or movie. The platform offers a straightforward interface, enabling users to save their preferred content for later viewing. Additionally, it provides subtitles in the user's preferred language, enhancing accessibility. Previously, I relied on Google search for entertainment, often encountering numerous advertisements. Now, Netflix has eliminated these challenges.",5,2025-02-05 19:29:44,Guess_what

My algorithm includes things I've already seen and stuff from the bbc and sky which I've already seen or won't watch. The lists all have the same content. Will be looking into what ultimate on demand actually entails because if it's just netflix then it'll probably be getting canceled. Nowhere near worth the money anymore. I'll never understand how the share price is so high when they offer next to nothing.,1,2025-02-05 18:28:56,J B

price increase in Jan 2025 seems to be to grab more money without new unique content that isn't Documentary or comedy specials. Takes years to release new seasons of a 8-10 episode series when networks have 24 episodes running year round. Seems like it may be time to move on from this service due to the continuous price increases. Other service(that have ads only at the start of the shows/movies) including cable tv (can fast forward past ads) have much better options for lower overall prices.,2,2025-02-05 17:59:19,an0ther w0nder

"Limited movies, anime. Slow release of new drama/movies/anime. Every release of new episode waiting time is damn slow, yet each episode length sometimes only for 20mins etc especially anime. Not much choices, mostly old dramas/movies. Not easy search. Filtering only show limited stuff. Overall, the release of new episode/season of each movies/animations/drama are slow and long waiting time with limited choices to watch it. All this should be improve else no point continue to subscribe Netflix.",2,2025-02-05 15:30:46,JACQ
